<p>MathPad is a tool for solving and storing mathematical equations in standard
algebraic syntax. It works just like the standard MemoPad app, except that if
you write down an equation and tap the Solve button, it computes the answer and
fills it in for you. These equations can be simple math expressions like
&quot;2+2=&quot;, or algebraic expressions using variables such as
&quot;sqrt(x+4) / acos(0.7) = y**3&quot;. MathPad provides operators for
exponentiation, bitwise AND, OR, NOT, and XOR, bit shifts, integer or modulo
division, comparisons, and Boolean logic. Functions for trigonometry (including
inverse and hyperbolics), logarithms, and date manipulation are also provided. <a
href="mathlib.html">MathLib</a> is required for use of the trigonometric
functions, but all other features work on any Pilot-compatible PDA, running any
OS version.</p>

<p>You can supply the values for the known variables and solve for a single
remaining unknown variable without the hassle of re-arranging the equation to
isolate the unknown. This allows you to easily play around with &quot;what
if&quot; questions which would normally be too hard to calculate. Say you're
shopping for a new house. Using the standard TVM (time value of money) formula,
you can enter the house price and mortgage interest rate to determine the
monthly payment. Payment too high? Put in your desired monthly payment, and
solve for the house price you can really afford. Or put in the house price and
payment you want, and solve for the interest rate you'll need to find to pull
it off. And unlike hardwired financial calculators, you can tailor the
equations to your special needs. Maybe you'd like to add the predicted property
taxes and insurance into your monthly payment total?</p>

<p>Also, if you enter a set of linked equations, MathPad can solve for multiple
unknown variables by repeatedly solving any equation in the set with a single
unknown until all the variables have been determined. For example, you can put
in the standard equations describing DC power expenditure (P=E*I, P=I**2*R, P=E**2/R)
and fill in any two of the four variables, and MathPad will figure out how to
compute <i>both</i> of the other two unknowns. MathPad doesn't handle
simultaneous equations, however; I'm afraid that's a bit too difficult for the
Pilot's memory and CPU constraints.</p>

<p>The equation records are maintained in a database file similar to MemoPad's,
allowing you to build a custom library of frequently-used equations for quick
reference. Structural engineers can archive their mass and stress calculations,
real estate agents or bankers can put in loan and annuity formulas,
anesthesiologists can compute dosages and blood gasses... whatever standard
equations you need are at your fingertips. And since the calculations are
written as text instead of being punched into a calculator, you can easily cut
and paste the equations and their results to and from other apps such as email,
or file your work for future reference.</p>


<hr size=2 width="100%" align=center>

<h3 align=center style='text-align:center'><a name="How_it_works"></a>How it
works</h3>

<p>MathPad combines a powerful algebraic expression parsing routine with a
highly optimized root finding convergence algorithm. When you tap the Solve
button, it searches the text of the current record for any equation with no
more than one unknown variable. If you've entered an incomplete equation with
no unknowns such as &quot;8.3**9=&quot;, MathPad simply computes the answer and
inserts it into the text for you. If it finds an equation with one unknown
variable, it solves for the unknown by repeatedly trying different possible
values for that variable until the equation works out correctly. First it
internally rephrases the equation into the form &quot;leftside minus
rightside&quot;, so that a correct value for the unknown would cause the entire
expression to equal 0. Then it tries to &quot;bracket&quot; the correct answer
by looking for one value which causes the expression to yield a positive result
(value too large), and another value which causes the expression to give a
negative result (value too small). Usually, the correct answer can be found
somewhere between those two values. Once it has identified a range which
contains the correct answer in it somewhere, it uses a fancy algorithm (the Van
Wijngaarden-Dekker-Brent method, from <i>Numerical Recipes in C</i>, 2nd ed.;
Press, W.H. 1995; Cambridge University Press, if you care) to rapidly narrow
the possible range and converge to the correct answer with as few tries as
possible. After setting the unknown variable to the correct answer, MathPad
restarts its search of the entire record to see if some other equation can now
be solved. This continues until no more solvable equations are found.</p>

<h3 align=center style='text-align:center'><a name=Limitations></a>Limitations</h3>

<p>While such a root finding algorithm is a very powerful and useful tool, it's
not perfect. Many equations can have multiple equally correct possible answers
(e.g. in &quot;x*x=4&quot;, x could be either 2 or -2), and MathPad makes no
attempt to find or display them all. For certain non-continuous or otherwise
&quot;strange&quot; equations, MathPad can simply fail to find an answer and
will give up. In particular, it does not understand or solve for imaginary or
complex numbers. In cases where one possible answer is positive and another
negative, a purposeful decision was made to preferentially bracket and find the
positive answer, since that's much more likely to be the useful answer for
real-world problems. If there are multiple correct positive answers, or no positive
answers and multiple correct negative answers, MathPad will simply display the
first one it stumbles across (generally the one closer to 0). Using MathPad to
solve an equation for you does not absolve you of the responsibility to
understand the equation and to exercise judgement in using the result. That
said, however, these sorts of concerns generally apply more to &quot;pure
mathematics&quot; problems in the theoretical realm than to the sort of actual,
real-world problems you're likely to need to solve. &quot;Real&quot; problems
involving tons, dollars, or cubic centimeters generally have only one correct
answer which MathPad can &quot;zero in&quot; on without confusion.</p>

<h3 align=center style='text-align:center'><a name=Installation></a>Installation</h3>

<p>There are two separate versions of the MathPad application program provided:
MathPSA.prc (Stand-Alone) and MathPML.prc (MathLib). You only need to install
one of them; which one will depend on which PalmPilot OS version you're
running, and how much memory you have available.</p>

<ul type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l2 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>If you're still using OS
     version 1.0 through 1.06 (or anything else before 2.0), you need to
     install MathPSA.prc. This version of MathPad has been compiled using the
     NewFloatMgr.lib library so that it doesn't require your Pilot to have the
     floating point math functions built into its ROM. Unfortunately, this
     version does not include the trigonometry functions, since those take up
     too much space to include in the program and are normally provided by
     MathLib, which doesn't work under OS 1.0. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l2 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>If you're using OS version
     2.0 or above, and you already have MathLib installed on your Pilot (or
     have enough free memory to do so), I recommend using MathPML.prc and
     MathLib.prc. This will allow MathPad to provide its full functionality,
     and if you already needed MathLib for some other program anyway, this
     takes up the least amount of additional memory. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l2 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>If you have OS 2.0+ but don't
     have MathLib (or room to add it), you can install MathPSA.prc to get the
     same capabilities as an OS 1.0 user, namely everything except the
     trigonometry functions. This might be a good compromise for those who don't
     do much trigonometry and are tight on memory.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you've decided, just use the Install Tool of your PalmPilot Desktop
software package to install either MathPSA.prc or MathPML.prc (and possibly
MathLib.prc) onto your PalmPilot.</p>

<p><b>Note: </b>You should <b>not</b> delete MathPad from memory when upgrading
to a newer version. Just use the install tool to install the new version of the
.PRC file over the old one. If you delete MathPad, your database of equations
is automatically deleted along with it. If you do this by accident, you can use
the install tool to re-install the MathPadDB.pdb file that was backed up into
your C:\Pilot\username\Backup directory</p>

<p>Also, I'd like to recommend <a
href="http://www.mindspring.com/~jetton/pilot/index.html">SelectHack</a> by
Jeff Jetton. It allows you to highlight an entire word of text with a
double-tap, and is great for easily deleting and replacing variables in MathPad
records.</p>

<p>MathLib is a free shared library that can be used by any OS 2.0 Pilot
program that needs IEEE 754 double precision math functions. It's distributed
under the terms of the GNU General Public License, and is freely available with
full source code and documentation at the <a
href="http://www.radiks.net/~rhuebner/mathlib.html">MathLib Information web page</a>.
It's not a part of the MathPad program, and you're not paying anything for its
use; a copy is simply included in this archive for your convenience.</p>

<p>If you decide to uninstall MathPad, use the standard Memory application
built into the ROM to delete it. The equation database is tied to MathPad, and
will be automatically deleted when MathPad is deleted. </p>

<h3 align=center style='text-align:center'><a name="Using_MathPad"></a>Using
MathPad</h3>

<p>MathPad is really very easy to use. It maintains a database of text records
which you create and edit just like the standard MemoPad application. To do
math, you essentially just write down an equation and tap Solve, and it does.
You can write your equations directly using Graffiti, or you may find it more
convenient to tap the &quot;123&quot; or &quot;abc&quot; dots in the lower
corners of the Graffiti area to bring up the keyboard. The elements of an
equation are:</p>

<h4>Operators</h4>

<p>The mathematical operators which MathPad recognizes are:</p>

<ol start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .5in'>Unary - (negative), unary +
     (positive), ~ (bitwise NOT), ! (logical NOT)</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .5in'>** (exponentiation)</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .5in'>* (multiplication), / (division),
     % (modulo)</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .5in'>+ (addition), - (subtraction)</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .5in'>&lt;&lt; (bit shift left),
     &gt;&gt; (arithmetic bit shift right)</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .5in'>&amp; (bitwise AND), |
     (bitwise OR), ^ (bitwise XOR)</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .5in'>== (equal to), != (not equal
     to), &lt; (less than), &lt;= (less than or equal to), &gt; (greater than),
     &gt;= (greater than or equal to)</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .5in'>&amp;&amp; (logical AND), ||
     (logical OR), ^^ (logical XOR)</li>
</ol>

<p>The operators are ranked according to precedence. In mixed expressions,
operators higher up in the list are evaluated first, while operators at the
same precedence are evaluated left to right. You can use parentheses to
override this order of evaluation as required. For example, &quot;1+2**3&quot;
equals 9, since ** comes before +, but &quot;(1+2)**3&quot; equals 27. MathPad
supports nested parentheses more than 50 levels deep..</p>

<p>The operators ~, &lt;&lt;, &gt;&gt;, &amp;, |, and ^ are computer logic
oriented bit manipulation operations which work on 32-bit signed integer
values. The values used with these operators must be whole numbers in the range
-(2**31) to 2**31-1. These operations are performed internally using signed
longs, so they'll wrap or overflow their results as required to stay within the
32-bit range.</p>

<p>The operators ==, !=, &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, and &gt;= are conditional test
operations. If the condition is true, the result is 1, otherwise the result is
0. Note that the equaltity test operator == requires two = signs, to
differentiate it from the equation symbol.</p>

<p>The operators !, &amp;&amp;, ||, and ^^ are Boolean logic operators for use
with the conditional test operations above. They're different from the bitwise
operators ~, &amp;, |, and ^ in that they consider the entire value as a whole
instead of bit by bit. They treat 0 as false and any other value as true, and
return 0 for false or 1 for true. For example, 1 &amp; 4 = 0 using the bitwise
operation, but 1 &amp;&amp; 4 = 1 since both values are nonzero. Note that the
meaning of the ! operator has changed; early versions of MathPad used this for
factorials, which are now done using the Fact() function to allow all the
standard C-style conditional operators to be used.</p>

<h4>Built-In Functions</h4>

<p>MathPad includes the following built-in functions. Function names are not
case sensitive; abs(), ABS(), and Abs() are equally valid. Note that all
trigonometry functions work in radians, not degrees; use the Degrees() and
Radians() functions as necessary to convert back and forth.</p>

<h4>Floating-point constants</h4>

<p>MathPad uses IEEE-754 double-precision floating point functions to provide
14 significant digits of accuracy from negative to positive 10**300
(approximately). You enter floating-point values in the standard computer
format of [-]digits[[decimal mark]digits][E[-]digits], e.g. &quot;1&quot;,
&quot;1.23&quot;, &quot;1.23E45&quot;, &quot;-12.1E-3&quot;, etc. The decimal
mark used is correctly determined from the Pilot's number format preferences.</p>

<h4><a name="Integer_In"></a>Integer constants</h4>

<p>Integer constants are entered in the format &quot;[-]digits#[base]&quot;,
e.g. 100#16 = 256, 100#8 = 64, etc. If the number base is omitted, it defaults
to 10. The first digit must be from 0-9 to differentiate the value from a
variable, so you may need to pad with a leading zero when using bases above 10,
e.g. FFFF#16 must be entered as 0FFFF#16. Any base from 2 through 36 may be
used.</p>

<h4>Variables</h4>

<p>Variable names can be any length, and are composed of the letters A to Z, a
to z, 0 to 9, the underscore character &quot;_&quot;, the dollar sign character
&quot;$&quot;, and the upper-128 symbols and international characters. The
first character of the variable name must be from A-Z or a-z. Variable names <b>are</b>
case sensitive; the variable &quot;t&quot; is different and separate from the
variable &quot;T&quot;. To use a variable in an equation, you must
&quot;declare&quot; it, that is, reserve a place for its current value to be
stored in your text somewhere. This is done by writing the variable name
followed by a colon (&quot;:&quot;) and optionally a single space or tab. When
MathPad needs to check if a variable is currently defined, it looks for
&quot;variable:&quot; in your text and uses the value it finds written there.
If no value is found, meaning the next thing MathPad sees after &quot;variable:&quot;
is not a number, the variable is considered unknown and MathPad will try to
solve for it and insert the answer after the colon.</p>

<p><a name="Integer_Out"></a>When MathPad solves for a variable and prints the
result, it normally uses floating-point format. To tell MathPad to print a
value as an integer using a specific number base, append &quot;#base&quot;
after the variable name in the declaration, e.g. &quot;x#16:&quot; to print x
as a base 16 (hexadecimal) integer instead of in floating-point format. MathPad
performs all its integer math using signed 32-bit longs, so the value may be
truncated to fit before being printed. Note that the &quot;#base&quot;
specification after a variable name only controls how that variable is printed
when solved for; it does not affect how that variable is read in if a value is
already set. </p>

<p>Variables may also be specially designated as &quot;input only&quot; or
&quot;output only&quot;, for extra convenience with equations which you usually
solve for the same variable each time. To mark a variable as &quot;input
only&quot;, declare it using &quot;&lt;-&quot; after the name instead of the
colon (e.g. &quot;x&lt;-&quot;). Variables declared this way are automatically
erased whenever the equation record is selected from the main display, with the
cursor left sitting at the first input variable of the record for immediate data
entry. There is also a menu command to &quot;Clear Input Variables&quot; which
will clear them again during use with a quick two-stroke shortcut
(&quot;/I&quot;). To mark a variable as &quot;output only&quot;, declare it
using &quot;-&gt;&quot; after the name instead of the colon (e.g.
&quot;x-&gt;&quot;). Variables declared this way are automatically erased
whenever the Solve button is tapped, so that they are always considered
unknown, and so are always solved for without requiring you to erase them each
time.</p>

<p>When a record contains more than one equation, MathPad normally tries to
automatically solve as many as possible whenever the Solve button is tapped. If
you want to verify the results of a variable's solution before continuing on to
use that variable in further equations, you can mark that variable as requiring
a &quot;confirmation breakpoint&quot; by appending a &quot;?&quot; after the
variable name (e.g. &quot;x?:&quot;). This causes MathPad to pop up a
confirmation dialog box showing the new value of x whenever x is solved for,
allowing you to either Continue or Halt the solution of the rest of the record
at that point.</p>

<p><a name=Precision></a>There are times when you need to force a variable to
always be computed with the maximum possible precision, rather than using the
current number format specified by the <a href="#Details">Details</a> window.
For example, if one equation computes a variable which will be used as an input
to another equation, and you currently have the number of output decimal places
set to 2, this intermediate value would normally be computed only to two
decimal places before being used in the second equation, and this loss of
precision could cause problems. To avoid this, you may specify &quot;x::&quot;
instead of &quot;x:&quot; for a normal variable, or &quot;x-&gt;&gt;&quot;
instead of &quot;x-&gt;&quot; for an output variable, to force that variable to
always be computed with full precision regardless of the current output
settings.</p>

<p><a name=Limits></a>Finally, you may sometimes need to manually specify the
limits of the range of possible answers which will be searched to solve for a
particular variable. If you know that the equation you're attempting to solve
has multiple valid answers, you can limit the range to be checked to force
MathPad to converge in the desired region. Since MathPad preferentially
searches for positive answers before negative ones, this can be used to force
it to generate a negative solution when necessary. Also, the automatic solution
&quot;bracketing&quot; algorithm sometimes fails when solving non-continuous
functions, so you can use this to manually set the limits when the automatic
search fails. To specify the limits of the range to be searched, specify both
the lower and the upper limits of the search range in square brackets,
separated by a &quot;:&quot;, between the variable name and the variable type
suffix, like this: &quot;vname[lowlimit:highlimit]-&gt;&quot; or
&quot;x[0:1E6]::&quot;.</p>

<h4>User-Defined Mathematical Constants</h4>

<p>MathPad also allows you to define your own named mathematical constants for
use in your calculations. This is handy for common values such as degrees to
radians conversions, pi, e, speed of light, weights &amp; measures conversions,
atomic weights, or whatever other values you refer to often. When MathPad is
searching for the value of a variable, it first searches the text of the
current record being edited. If the variable is not declared anywhere in the
current record, MathPad then tries to look for a record named
&quot;Constants&quot;, and if it exists, will also search that record for the
variable as well. Only if the variable does not exist in either the current
record or the Constants record will MathPad report an Undeclared Variable
error.</p>

<p>To define your own named constants, just create a record with the title
&quot;Constants&quot;, and then define as many variables in that record as you
like. You must declare each constant with the standard variable suffix
&quot;:&quot; (input and output variable types don't apply), and you should
enter the value as a floating point number with as many decimal places as
possible for best accuracy when used.</p>

<h4>User-Defined Functions</h4>

<p>You can also define your own mathematical functions, which can then be
called from within any math expression in MathPad. This is done by creating a
record with the title &quot;Functions&quot;, and entering your new function
definitions into this record in the following format:</p>

<pre style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:
.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>funcname(arg1;arg2) = sqrt(arg1)*arg2/pi()</pre>

<p>You can then use this new function just like the standard ones, like so:</p>

<pre style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:
.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>x**3 = y + funcname(x+5;y) / 7</pre>

<p>Each function can accept from 0 to 32 arguments, which can be named anything
you like. When the function is called, these temporary variables will be set to
the values passed in the function call, the math expression after the
&quot;=&quot; will be evaluated, and the answer will be returned as the result
of the call. Note that function names must follow the rules for variable names,
and so are case-sensitive, unlike the built-in functions. The function
definition can use constants from your &quot;Constants&quot; page, built-in
functions, and other user-defined functions, but can't access any variables
except its function call arguments. Also, you must be careful to avoid indirect
infinite loops from having two functions call each other; a() can call b(), but
then b() had better not call a() again or you'll end up pressing Reset.
Finally, if your function definition spans multiple lines, you must surround it
in curly braces (see Equations, below).</p>

<p>Since MathPad can't easily switch away from the record you're solving, any
errors that occur during the execution of a user-defined function will leave
the cursor at the closing &quot;)&quot; of the offending call. Also, if you
press Solve while editing the Functions record, the solver will think the function
definitions are equations and report Undeclared Variable and Unknown Function
errors. For these reasons it's best to debug your custom functions as equations
within a normal MathPad record, and then cut &amp; paste them into your
Functions record once they're fully tested.</p>

<h4>Equations</h4>

<p>An equation is simply two mathematical expressions joined with the
&quot;=&quot; character. When you tap the Solve button, MathPad will scan your
text for equations to solve by looking for any &quot;=&quot; characters. When
it finds one, it then has to determine the boundaries of the equation in your
text. By default, MathPad will assume that the equation has been written on a
line by itself, and that its ends are therefore marked by the previous and
following newline characters. If your equation needs to span more than one
line, or if you want to put other text on the same line before or after the
equation, you must explicitly mark the boundaries of the equation by
surrounding it in curly braces, like this &quot;Example: { x + 5 = y }&quot;.
These braces are not required if the equation automatically wraps to another
line, only if you explicitly insert a newline character. Within an equation,
you can use spaces and tabs as desired to make things more readable, except
that variable names, function names, and multi-character operators like
&quot;**&quot; or &quot;&lt;&lt;&quot; must not be broken up.</p>

<h4>Page Position Commands</h4>

<p>These commands let you control where within the text of the current record
the display is scrolled to, so that it automatically jumps to a particular page
of the text when you select the record from the main display (and when the
&quot;Clear Input Variables&quot; menu option is selected), and to another page
of the text after the Solve button is tapped. You can use this to clean up the
display for more convenient use by setting up a separate area in the text for
entering input values, and another area in the text for displaying output
results, so that you don't have to see all the equations and other variables in
the record. To set where the display will be positioned when the record is
entered, put the command &quot;--Input--&quot; on a line in the record. The
display will automatically be scrolled so that the <i>following</i> line of
text is the first line on the display (with the &quot;--Input--&quot; command
just off the top edge) when the record is entered or the input variables are
cleared. The cursor will be placed at the first input variable, if any. To set
where the display will be positioned after the Solve button is tapped, use the
command &quot;--Output--&quot;. You may need to add extra blank lines to the end
of your record to allow it to be scrolled down far enough to go to the position
you've specified; if your position command is too close to the end of the
record, the display will simply be scrolled to the bottom of the record and the
line with the command will still be visible.</p>

<h4>Write-Protected Areas</h4>

<p>To help prevent accidental alteration of your equations, you can
write-protect areas of your text by enclosing them between /* and */ markers.
Once you've marked an area of text as protected, MathPad will try to keep you
from altering it. You can still select and copy from such areas, but you won't
be able to insert, delete, cut or paste anything there (unless you cut the
entire area out at one time). To disable the protection, just delete or change
one of the markers; they aren't protected, the area between them is. There's
one loophole: the popup keyboard dialog edits the record text directly without
involving MathPad, so it completely ignores this protection. This is either a
problem or a convenient temporary bypass feature, depending on how often you
normally use the popup keyboard. Also, this protection only applies to your
changes, not MathPad's; MathPad will still solve for and update variables
within protected regions, so you can protect output variable declarations if
you like. Protecting input variable declarations is a bad idea.</p>

<h4>Comments</h4>

<p>Finally, any text surrounded by double quotes, &quot;like this&quot;, is
considered a comment and is ignored. You don't need to mark all of your
comments or notes this way, since MathPad only pays attention to equations, but
it can be useful if you want to use &quot;=&quot; or other characters with
special meanings in your notes.</p>

<h3 align=center style='text-align:center'>Putting it all together</h3>

<p>If you just want to perform a simple calculation instead of solving an
equation, you have two options. You can write any mathematical expression
surrounded by back-slant characters, e.g. &quot;\ 2**32 - 1 \&quot;, and
MathPad will solve the expression and <b>replace</b> it with the answer in your
text. Or, you can write an incomplete equation such as &quot;2**32 - 1 =&quot;,
and MathPad will <b>insert</b> the answer at the = sign. These simple
calculations can use any operators, functions, or variables you like, except
that any variables used must already have known values, since they're not
phrased in a way which would let MathPad solve for any unknowns. If any unknown
variables are used, MathPad will simply leave the expression untouched.</p>

<p>To solve an equation for an unknown, you just write in the equation(s),
declare storage space for any variables you use, and fill in any known values.
When you tap Solve, MathPad will fill in the values of any unknown variables
used in your equation(s) which it was able to solve for.</p>

<h4>Example: Mortgage payments</h4>

<p>Write the following text into a MathPad record:</p>

<pre style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:

<p>This sets up the standard time value of money formula and calculates what
value of house can be bought with a monthly payment of $1000 on a 30-year
mortgage at 7.2% interest per year. When you tap Solve, MathPad will locate the
equations and solve the first one for the unknown variable mint. This reduces
the number of unknowns in the second equation to 1, so it then solves that
equation for the unknown variable pv. To solve for a different variable, just
erase its value and tap Solve again. You can easily play around with changing
different values and solving for any unknown as desired. Note the use of the
&quot;-&gt;&gt;&quot; precision output variable type for mint; this is
necessary because we need mint to be computed with full precision regardless of
the current output format set in the Details window (below).</p>

<h3 align=center style='text-align:center'><a name=Details></a>Details</h3>

<p>The Details window lets you delete the record, set the category for the
record, mark the record as private, or set the output number format options.
The Format option allows you to choose the desired format of any answers which
MathPad prints into your record. &quot;Float&quot; is the normal floating-point
format, &quot;Sci&quot; is for scientific notation, and &quot;Eng&quot; is for
engineering notation. The Decimal Places option sets the desired precision; you
can select from 0 to 14 decimal places of accuracy in your results. MathPad
always computes all results to 15 decimal places, and then rounds the result to
the precision selected when printing. The Strip Zeros option tells MathPad
whether it should remove any trailing zeros from the result. For example, when
calculating in dollars, you'd set Decimal Places to 2 and turn Strip Zeros off.
If you're using any intermediate variables which will be used in other
equations (such as &quot;mint&quot; in the example above), remember to override
these output format settings to force the values to be computed in full precision
using &quot;::&quot; or &quot;-&gt;&gt;&quot;; see the <a href="#Precision">Variables</a>
section for details.</p>

     answer, and you should change the limits and try again. This is especially
     likely to be the case when the &quot;closest guess&quot; answer which is
     returned is the same as one of your specified limits; this means the
     solver ran into your limit while converging, and was forced to give up
     before minimizing the error to 0. If this error happens when you haven't
     manually set the limits, it probably means that you're trying to solve a
     poorly-behaved non-continuous function, and the automatic solution
     bracketing algorithm guessed badly when trying to determine the limits on
     its own. In this case, you'll need to specify the limits yourself to force
     MathPad to avoid the false &quot;local minima&quot; solution that it
     stumbled into.</li>

<h3 align=center style='text-align:center'><a name="Backup_&amp;_Recovery"></a>Backup
&amp; Recovery</h3>

<p>The PalmPilot Desktop software creates a directory named something like
C:\Pilot\&lt;username&gt;\Backup, and stores backup copies of your system
preferences and other settings there whenever you Hotsync. MathPad marks its
equation database as requiring this kind of backup, so all of your equations
will be automatically backed up as a file named MathPadDB.pdb in this
directory. <b>Warning:</b> Hotsync version 1.0 has a bug which causes it to
only back up the first 32 files installed on your Pilot. Anyone still using 1.0
should consider getting the <a
href="http://www.usr.com/palm/custsupp/hs11rdme.html">free 1.1 upgrade</a> from
USR's web site, especially if they have a lot of stuff installed. </p>

<p>Should your Pilot require a hard reset or suffer battery failure, it could
lose its memory. If this happens, just do a Hotsync after fixing the problem,
and all files in the backup directory will be automatically reinstalled. What
many don't realize is that you can stick application .PRC files into this
directory yourself, and they'll be automatically reinstalled after the reset as
well. The only problem is that the apps you put there are deleted after the
restore, so you'll need to recopy them back into the backup directory again
afterwards. </p>

<p>What I've done on my system is create a C:\Pilot\Huebner\Apps directory, and
whenever I find a new app that I want to keep around, I copy it into this
directory and into the Backup directory. If my Pilot loses its memory, I do a
Hotsync and everything is automatically reinstalled. Then I just copy the
contents of the App directory back into the Backup directory so that it'll be
ready again for the next time. </p>

<p>If your Pilot loses its memory and you haven't prepared like this, it's not
a disaster; it just means you have to go back and re-install all the .PRC files
you had before using the Install Tool. It's a drag, but no real loss. Either
way, your equations will have been automatically backed up and then restored,
giving you one less thing to worry about. </p>

<h4 align=center style='text-align:center'><a name=Reinstalling></a>Reinstalling
Backed-Up Database Files</h4>

<p>MathPad versions 1.3 and earlier had a problem installing the MathPadDB.pdb
file with MathPad already installed, when using certain combinations of Hotsync
and PalmOS. This problem has been fixed in version 1.4. It no longer matters
whether MathPad is already installed or not when you install the database file.</p>


<hr size=2 width="100%" align=center>


<h3 align=center style='text-align:center'><a name=Exporting></a>Exporting and
Importing MathPad Records</h3>

<p>MathPad now includes full IR beaming support.  You can beam individual records or full categories to other MathPad users.  
To beam a single record, open that record for use, and then select the Beam Record menu option.  If the receiving handheld is not currently running 
MathPad, it will ask the user if it should interrupt what they're currently doing and accept the MathPad data.  If the receiving handheld 
is already running MathPad, the record will be accepted automatically without prompting.  The receiving MathPad will then jump to the new record 
and display it to the user.</p>

<p>To beam an entire category of records, go to the main display and select the category to be beamed using the category selector in the upper right corner, then select 
the Beam Category menu option.  This works just like sending individual records, except that every record in the current category will be sent.  
If the current category is "All", then every MathPad record you have will be sent; make sure this is what you intended, or select a specific 
category before beaming.  If any records in the category are marked as Private, they will not be sent; Private records must be sent one by one 
using individual Beam Record commands to prevent accidental disclosure.</p>

<p>Two utility programs are included with MathPad to give you access to the
equation records stored in the backed up MathPad database file on your PC.
MpExport copies the records from the database file to a plain text file that
you can edit with your favorite editor, print, give or email to others, etc.
MpImport copies the records from a plain text file back into your MathPad
database file, which you can then reinstall on your Pilot using the standard
install tool (see the <a href="#Reinstalling">Reinstalling</a> section above).</p>

<p>Windows executables for these utilities are included, plus simple
ANSI-standard C source code for other platforms. Since these programs need to
be portable, they're executed from the command line (MS-DOS window or
whatever).</p>

<p>Also available for Mac users: <a
href="http://www.radiks.net/~rhuebner/MPIO.sit">MPIO.sit</a>; Macintosh versions
of the MpExport and MpImport utilities (renamed ToAscii and ToPDB in this
archive), with source code. Thanks to Roger Gabin for translating these.</p>

<p>Unix users should be able to just do a &quot;cc mpexport.c -o mpexport&quot;
or equivalent to generate a native executable for their system.</p>

<p>I decided to write these export/import utilites rather than doing a fancy
desktop app and conduit for two main reasons: 1) Palm has made it insanely
difficult to write conduits, and 2) this way, the solution works on all
platforms, instead of being restricted to Windows systems (since I have no way
to create any Mac or Unix software).</p>

<h4 align=center style='text-align:center'>MpExport</h4>

<p>MpExport is very simple to use. Copy MPEXPORT.EXE into a standard directory
in your search path, open a command line window, go to the directory where your
Pilot files are backed up (usually C:\Pilot\&lt;username&gt;\Backup) and enter
&quot;mpexport mathpaddb.pdb mathpad.txt&quot; to create a simple text file named
&quot;mathpad.txt&quot; containing all the records in
&quot;mathpaddb.pdb&quot;. This output text file will be created if necessary,
or overwritten if it already exists. You can then edit this text file with
Notepad or any other standard text editor, print it, cut records from it to
paste into an email message, or whatever. </p>

<p>Windows users might want to make an icon to run the program automatically if
you expect to be using it often, perhaps writing the text file out to your
C:\Windows\Desktop directory to have the exported text file pop up on your
desktop for easy access.</p>

<p>If you edit the text file, be sure to stick to the record format which
MpExport used when it wrote the file, so that MpImport will know how to read it
back in again. The Category and Places lines are optional, but must be in the
order and format exported if used. The record separator line must appear
between records, and must be copied exactly as exported.</p>

<h4 align=center style='text-align:center'>MpImport</h4>

<p>MpImport is a bit more complicated to use than MpExport. When you run it,
you have the option of either making the changes directly to your backed up
database file, or of writing a new database file which incorporates the changes
so that the current database is left alone as insurance. You would make the
changes to the current file by entering &quot;mpimport mathpaddb.pdb
mathpad.txt&quot;, or you'd write a new file by entering &quot;mpimport
mathpaddb.pdb mathpad.txt newmpdb.pdb&quot;. Note that MpImport can't create a
new MathPad database from scratch; it requires an existing MathPad database as
a starting point and then incorporates the text file records into that. This
ensures that your categories, registration data, etc. are carried forward
correctly from one database to the next.</p>

<p>MpImport works by copying the entire contents of the text file you specify
into your MathPad database file. You should edit the file before running
MpImport to make sure that it contains only the records you actually want to
import. As it processes each record in the text file, it checks to see if a
record with the same title already exists in your current database. If not, it
goes ahead and adds it to the database automatically. If there's already a
record by that name, and it's different than the one in the text file, it asks
you whether it should overwrite the current version of that record in your database.
If you say yes, the old version of the record in your database is replaced by
the version from the text file. If you say no, the new version from the text
file is added to your database alongside the original. When a record is added
to your database, MpImport automatically adds that record's category to your
database's category list if necessary. If your category list is already full
(16 categories is the limit, including Unfiled), MpImport marks the new record
as Unfiled instead.</p>

<p>After importing the text records into your database, just install the
updated database in your Pilot using the standard install tool. Due to a
problem with HotSync, it's currently necessary to delete the entire MathPad
program and database from your Pilot before installing the updated database.
The MathPad.prc application file must be reinstalled in your Pilot <i>after</i>
installation of the database file. This can still be done during a single
HotSync session, as long as you select the files for installation in the
correct order. See the <a href="#Reinstalling">Reinstalling</a> section above</p>


<hr size=2 width="100%" align=center>

<h3 align=center style='text-align:center'><a name=Registration></a>Registration</h3>

<p>As you'd probably expect after reading this far through this nice manual I
went to the trouble of writing, MathPad is shareware. It's not, however,
crippleware or constantly-in-your-face-ware or even plead&amp;whineware. I
don't like those sorts of programs when I download them, so I won't distribute
one myself. The only &quot;persuasion&quot; MathPad applies is that it will
remind you to pay for what you've gotten every couple of weeks. Starting with
the 5th such biweekly reminder, these reminders will insist on sticking around
for a few seconds before you can dismiss them, and this delay will increase
slightly with each subsequent biweekly reminder. This will allow plenty of time
for a lengthy evaluation, while still providing some motivation to eventually
get around to registering if you keep it for more than a few months.</p>

<p>If you like MathPad enough to give it a permanent home in your Pilot, you
may register it for the entirely reasonable low price of $10 to $12 US
(depending on processing surcharge). Registered users will receive a code to
turn off the registration reminders (which will work with all future updates),
and are automatically notified by email when new versions are available. They
also enjoy the smug satisfaction of knowing that they're helping to encourage
the production of fine software like this for their Pilot, and (more to the
point) that they're helping to encourage me to continue supporting and
improving it instead of giving up on the whole thing in disgust. </p>

<p>In an attempt to make it as painless as possible for you to give me your
money, I've set up several ways to register MathPad. The cost of registration
varies somewhat depending on the method used. I'm charging such a low price for
my software that I can't just absorb the stiff fees some payment processing
companies impose, but rather than raise my prices across the board, I've
decided to pass on my cost of using each payment system and let you choose for
yourself.<o:p></o:p></p>

<h3 align=center style='text-align:center'><a name="Maintenance_Notes"></a>Version
History</h3>

<p>Version 1.5, October 15, 2000: Added full IR beaming support. You can now beam individual records or entire record categories to other MathPad users. Also added Degrees/Radians selection to preferences, to set the default units used by the trig functions. Fixed a problem with double underlining under some OS versions.</p>

<p>Version 1.4, April 18th, 1999: Added quick pick list for entering function
names, ability to write-protect areas of the record by enclosing them in /* and
*/ marks, <a href="#Integer In">input</a> and <a href="#Integer Out">output</a>
of integers in base 2 through 36, root() function (root(x;y) = x**(1.0/y)), and
improved reporting of NAN and INF error results. Fixed problem with installing
database after program with some Hotsync/PalmOS combinations, stack overflows
with some very complex or deeply nested functions, imprecise results for
certain trig values (sin(radians(180)) now = exactly 0), and scroll arrow
updates after cut/paste/undo. Includes updated MathLib which is slightly
smaller and fixes problem with cbrt() returning bad results from 0.5 to 1.0.</p>

<p>Version 1.3, February 26th, 1998: Added a user-defined &quot;Functions&quot;
record, so you can add your own math functions to the ones built in. Expanded
the allowable character set for variable names to include '$' and the upper-128
symbols and international letters.</p>

<p>Version 1.2, February 17th, 1998: Added a stand-alone version that doesn't
require MathLib, so it can run under OS 1.0+ (but without the trig functions).
Added scientific and engineering notation output capability. Improved the
detection of certain syntax errors, which caused crashes instead of being
reported. Corrected the docs to show the proper name of the Weekday function is
Weekday, not WDay. Added a Graffiti Help menu command for 2.0 users.</p>

<p>Version 1.11, October 14th, 1997: Fixed (I think) a subtle stack overflow
bug that caused erratic Fatal Errors during or after solving equations with
nested parenthesis or function calls. I'm pretty sure this is solid now; please
let me know if you're still seeing this problem.</p>

<p>Version 1.1, October 1st, 1997: Added date and time functions, comparison
and logical operators, and If and Choose functions. Added two utility programs,
MpExport and MpImport, which copy equation records between a backed up MathPad
database file and a plain text file on your PC so you can share equations with
other users, edit long records with a text editor, etc. Windows executables for
these utilities are included, plus simple ANSI-standard C source code for other
platforms. Added a confirmation breakpoint variable flag for the crew at
Baylor. Now allows use of the &quot;_&quot; character in variable names. Fixed
a problem that caused the root finder to stop converging too early in some
cases, which could result in slightly inaccurate answers when solving for a
variable. Fixed a problem with updating the scroll arrows after a Solve. Fixed
the automatic selection of uppercase shift mode when creating a new record.
Added the operator precedence chart to the Tips window in the record view.</p>

<p>Version 1.01, August 24th, 1997: Fixed a problem that caused some math
library routines to lock up or die with Fatal Exception errors under some
obscure conditions. Fixed the preferences dialog frame.</p>

<p>Version 1.0, August 19th, 1997: Major update. Added trig and log functions
via new <a href="http://www.radiks.net/~rhuebner/mathlib.html">MathLib</a>
shared library (freely usable in your own programs!). New mathematical
constants lookup page, ability to specify solver search limits, display
positioning controls, and large font option. Now returns to last position when
launched (for easier cut &amp; paste and use with SwitchHack). Fixed 0! bug,
problem with scientific notation constants in expressions, and problem when one
variable name matched the end of another.</p>

<p>Version 0.82alpha, May 30th, 1997: Fixed the infinite solutions bug (I
think), improved handling of undeclared variables, added ability to designate
variables as &quot;input only&quot; (automatically cleared when record loaded
or by menu command) or &quot;output only&quot; (automatically cleared when
Solve is tapped, thus always solved for), and added Undo Last Solve menu
command.</p>

<p>Version 0.81alpha, May 29th, 1997: Fixed a last-minute typo that caused
problems solving for small fractions under some conditions, preventing MathPad
from solving the mortgage example for the interest rate.</p>

<p>Version 0.8alpha, May 28th, 1997: Original release. </p>
